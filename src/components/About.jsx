            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>"My name is Luigi Ricardo da Silva. I am a 22-year-old Brazilian student pursuing a degree in Information Systems at UNIFEI. Currently in my second year, I am looking for an opportunity to launch my career in the technology sector as a Developer (Intern, Trainee, or Junior). I have built a solid foundation in web and software development, with proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. My technical skillset also extends to data management using SQL and Power BI, alongside cloud fundamentals in AWS. Additionally, I am skilled in GIMP and Photoshop, allowing me to bridge the gap between backend logic and visual presentation. Professionally, I am known for my analytical thinking and collaborative spirit. I thrive in team settings and am deeply committed to continuous learning, ensuring I stay up-to-date with the ever-evolving tech landscape."</p>
